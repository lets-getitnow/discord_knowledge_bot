# Indexing Lock Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a thread-safe locking mechanism to ensure only one indexing operation can run at a time across all index/re-index commands.

## Changes Made

### 1. Bot Main Class (`bot/main.py`)

#### Added Async Lock
- **Line 52**: Added `self.indexing_lock = asyncio.Lock()` to provide proper async synchronization
- **Lines 56-58**: Added `is_indexing_in_progress()` method for consistent lock checking
- **Lines 65-71**: Added `get_indexing_status()` method for debugging/monitoring

#### Updated Indexing Method
- **Lines 134-171**: Completely rewrote `start_indexing()` method with proper async lock usage:
  - Pre-check if lock is already acquired (non-blocking check)
  - Acquire lock using `async with` context manager
  - Double-check `is_indexing` flag after lock acquisition (defense against race conditions)
  - Guaranteed lock release in `finally` block

#### Enhanced Documentation
- **Lines 5-8**: Updated file-level documentation to include indexing lock requirements

### 2. Indexing Commands (`bot/commands/indexing_commands.py`)

#### Updated Lock Checks
- **Lines 53, 88, 129, 187**: Replaced direct `self.bot.is_indexing` checks with `self.bot.is_indexing_in_progress()` calls
- This ensures all commands use the same lock-checking logic

### 3. Test Suite (`test/test_indexing_lock.py`)

#### Comprehensive Test Coverage
- **Single Operation Test**: Verifies normal indexing works correctly
- **Concurrent Operation Test**: Confirms second operation is blocked while first is running
- **Exception Handling Test**: Ensures lock is released even when indexing fails
- **Lock State Test**: Validates lock checking logic
- **Status Reporting Test**: Verifies status monitoring works

## Key Features

### Race Condition Prevention
1. **Non-blocking Lock Check**: Quick pre-check prevents unnecessary waiting
2. **Double-check Pattern**: Eliminates race condition between check and lock acquisition
3. **Atomic Lock Operations**: Uses `asyncio.Lock()` for proper async synchronization

### Guaranteed Cleanup
- Lock is always released via `finally` block, even on exceptions
- Both `is_indexing` flag and lock are reset on completion/failure

### Consistent Interface
- All commands use the same `is_indexing_in_progress()` method
- Centralized status checking prevents inconsistencies

## Testing Results
All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Single indexing operation works correctly
- ✅ Concurrent operations are properly blocked
- ✅ Exceptions don't leave lock in stuck state
- ✅ Lock checking is accurate before acquisition
- ✅ Status reporting works correctly

## Usage
The lock is transparent to users - they will simply see "Indexing is already in progress" messages if they try to start multiple operations simultaneously. The first operation to start will complete normally, and subsequent operations can be started after completion.
